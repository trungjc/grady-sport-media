Simple Subscribe is the only bulletproof secure plugin, that is easy to use and developers friendly as well. It gives you the power to simply add subscription
form to your Wordpress website, as a **widget**, **shortcode** or using php in your template codes.

This plugin has integrated [ReadyGraph](http://readygraph.com/), an optional set of features to automate the growth of your userbase.  It helps you achieve the three goals of any web marketer: maximize conversion of site visitors to register for your email list, maximize viral referrals for your site, and maximize return visits to your site.  To accomplish this, we have integrated a key set of growth features with this plugin:
	- Intelligent signup popup with email or one-click Facebook login
	- Full viral referral flow
	- Automated end user re-engagement emails including welcome emails, weekly digest, friend joined alert and more (all email campaigns are optional and configurable)
	- Enhanced email deliverabilty
	- Cloud-based analytics and data storage
	- Settings that allow you to turn on and off all ReadyGraph features.


Subscription form can gather more than just e-mail address, you can select additional fields like name, location, age and interests. All the subscribers can
be exported into **.csv**, **.xls**, **.tsv** or **.xml** format and used anywhere else, in fact, you can even select to export by criteria **active**, or **inactive** or simply **all**.

Your subscribers have the option to unsubscribe in each e-mail digest they receive, or you can put unsubscription form on your website. As of now, all use HTML template,
and the new post digest uses short excerpt, with post title and post featured image (if there is any). In future I plan to add different e-mail template options (see below in road-map).
Your digest email can contain your favourite social media links, just set them up simply in the admin, and they appear automatically in the e-mail. You can even try
sending a post digest only to yourself, so you can see what it looks like, the option is Admin > Subscribers > Settings, on the right hand side.

All Wordpress registered users have the option to subscribe simply in their Wordpress profile, by checking *E-mail subscriptions* in **Personal Options** section.

Forms have both client / server side validation and they are literally bulletproof. There plenty of other features you will find "on the run".

**New** you can change the look of the e-mail digest, colours, type etc. and contact all your subscribers directly with your own Subject and Message right from your Wordpress dashboard.

If you are a **Developer**, what you're looking for is [here.](http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-subscribe/other_notes/ "Developer's Guide")

= ReadyGraph App =

ReadyGraph is a system that automates the growth of your site’s userbase. It is optimized to deliver audience growth and motivate users to consistently revisit your site.

= Optimized Signup Form =

ReadyGraph’s signup form with intelligent pop-up functionality and one-click login is designed to maximize signups to your email list.  You can configure when the popup appears so as to maximize the likelihood that the user is engaged enough to register for your list.

= Viral Friend Invites =

ReadyGraph adds a friend invite process to your site’s signup flow.  We then power the entire viral loop by sending email and Facebook invitations that encourage your visitors’ friends to signup for your site.

= Automated Re-engagement Emails =

ReadyGraph’s automated email system encourages visitors to return to your site.   Users receive optimized emails such as a welcome email, re-engagement email, regular digest with new content from your blog, and social emails.  All emails are configurable including the ability to turn on and off individual campaigns.  We handle all sending to maximize deliverability.

Subscribers will receive automated email updates based on these actions.

== Developer's Guide ==

= Intro =

Apart from being able to use **widgets** and **shortcodes** in your Wordpress installation to display subscription and unsubscription forms, as a developer,
you sometimes need more methods of controlling your content and theme behaviour. But before we jump on php examples, I'm gonna list styling used by this plugin
so you can amend the look of forms and messages in the front end. There's a stylsheet with some styling for these form included in front-end of the website,
if you wish to not load my stlyes, just turn them off in **Subscribers > Settings**. So here goes the styles:

`
/* General */
span.error {} // error message
span.success {} // success message

/* Widgets */
.widgetGuts {} // widget insides
.widgetGuts dt {} // odd / even rows
.widgetGuts dd {}
.widgetGuts dt label { } // label field
.widgetGuts dt label.required { } // required label field
.widgetGuts dd input { } // input fields
.widgetGuts dd textarea { } // input fields
.widgetGuts dd input.button { } // submit button

/* Shortcodes */
.shortcode,
.widgetGuts.shortcode {} // either one of them, guts of shortcode
.shortcode h3 {} // form title
.shortcode table {} // form table
.shortcode table tr {} // table row
.shortcode table tr.required {} // required
.shortcode table tr th {} // holds label
.shortcode table tr td {} // holds input / textarea
.shortcode table tr th label {} // label
.shortcode table tr td input,
.shortcode table tr td textarea {} // input fields
.shortcode table tr td input.button {} // submit button
`

Now when styles are out of the way, let's look at those dev examples.

= Examples =

Let's check what we can do, we're gonna be using class called `Developers`. To retrieve an
object of our form we simply call:

`
<?php
	// get subscription form
	$subscriptionForm = \SimpleSubscribe\Developers::getSubscriptionForm();

	// or unsubscription one, whichever one you need
	$unsubscriptionForm = \SimpleSubscribe\Developers::getUnsubscriptionForm();
?>
`

With the form object we can do wonders, consider this code:

`
<?php
	// get form object
	$subscriptionForm = \SimpleSubscribe\Developers::getSubscriptionForm();

	// check if form was submitted
	if($subscriptionForm->isSubmitted()){
		// form was submitted
	}

	// check if form was submitted and was valid = that means, there were no errors
	// and subscriber was successfully added / or unsubscribed (depends on which form we have in our object)
    if($subscriptionForm->isSubmitted() && $subscriptionForm->isValid()){
    	// form was submitted - and valid, saved in db show your messages.
	}


	// check if form was submitted and had erros, those can be non-valid fields,
	// subscriber with same address already in system, etc.
	if($subscriptionForm->isSubmitted() && $subscriptionForm->hasErrors()){
		// dump erorrs
		dump($subscriptionForm->getAllErrors());
		// Note: method $subscriptionForm->getAllErrors() retrieves all errors, you can list them using foreach
		// or save them, do whatever you wish to do.
    }

    // display form
	echo $subscriptionForm;

`

= Advanced Example =

That is some funky stuff isn't it. Let's create a life like example for ourselves, one used in everyday situations. Imagine that we have a website
with for example a modal window, with a nice subscription form. That modal window is a hidden element that appears if some clicks on button called
"Subscribe". The form shows up in a modal window, everything is great, but what happens when you send the form? Since we don't use ajax calls to submit the form,
it's going to refresh the whole page thus making the modal window element hidden again with keen information about form being successfully sent or not.
Now that is excactly the case where we use `Developers` class instead of shortcodes and widgets, and help ourselves to control that situation.
Consider this code:

`
	<?php
		// get our subscription form
		$subscriptionForm = \SimpleSubscribe\Developers::getSubscriptionForm();
		// with this we determine modal windows class, since it's hidden automatically,
		// with every submission, we should make it visible, therefore add class "visible"
		$modalWindowVisible = $subscriptionForm->isSubmitted() ? 'visible' : '';
		// just empty variable to be filled with errors / success message
		$subscriptionMessage = '';
		// is it valid or not?
		if($subscriptionForm->isSubmitted() && $subscriptionForm->isValid()){
			// it is, this is our messages
			$subscriptionMessage = 'You have succesfully subscribed, e-mail is on it\'s way!';
		} elseif($subscriptionForm->isSubmitted() && $subscriptionForm->hasErrors()) {
			// it's not! get error messages in variable
			$subscriptionMessage = print_r($subscriptionForm->getAllErrors(), TRUE);
		}
	?>
	<style type="text/css">
		.modalWindow { display: none; }
		.modalWindow.visible { display: block; }
	</style>
	<div id="modalWindow" class="modalWindow <?php echo $modalWindowVisible; ?>">
		<?php
			// print message, if any
			echo $subscriptionMessage;
			// display form
			echo $subscriptionForm;
		?>
	</div>
	<button onclick="displayModal()">Show Modal</button>
	<script type="text/javascript">
		function displayModal(){
			document.getElementById("modalWindow").className = "visible";
		}
	</script>
`

Right, let's go through this code again, it's pretty straightforward. At first, we create an instance of our form, we check if it was submitted, if it was - no matter
if correctly or not, we should always display our hidden modal window, so people can see it straight away after the page reloads - we set the modal window class to "visible".

After that it's simple code, just to show working example of that logic, you can copy and paste this code or change, amend, whatever you wish to do.
