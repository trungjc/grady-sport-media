Each of these pages you can use as-is or with new blocks from a UI Kit.<br/><br/>These Samples will guide you through and show how to use the blocks and give you the feeling on how to play around using the components in the website building process. Plus, it will save you time! You can decide whether to create your site using UI Kit blocks or samples."
